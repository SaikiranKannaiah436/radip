# An implementation of LSTM with Recurrent Batch Normalization.

This implementation is based on the following paper:

Tim Cooijmans, Nicolas Ballas, César Laurent, Çağlar Gülçehre, Aaron Courville, "Recurrent Batch Normalization," https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09025

The implementation of [DCGAN in TensorFlow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) was referred to implement the batch normalization functionality and incorporate it into LSTM cell of TensorFlow.
